:Test-Layer: unit

Create some test classes so that we don't need to import real
locations and events::

   >>> class DummyLocation(object):
   ...     def __init__(self, name, hideUntil):
   ...         self.name = name
   ...         self.hideUntil = hideUntil
   ...     def __str__(self):
   ...         return "@ %s" % self.name

   >>> class DummyEvent(object):
   ...     def __init__(self, start, end, location, startOriginal):
   ...         self.start = start
   ...         self.end = end
   ...         self.majorLocation = location
   ...         self.startOriginal = startOriginal
   ...     def __repr__(self):
   ...         return "<%d-%d %s>" % (
   ...             self.start, self.end, self.majorLocation)

Create test objects where we have some meaningful locations and amount
of events::

   >>> cave = DummyLocation("cave", 3)
   >>> home = DummyLocation("home", 3)
   >>> events = [
   ...     DummyEvent(1, 2, cave, 1),
   ...     DummyEvent(1, 2, home, 1),
   ...     DummyEvent(4, 5, cave, 3),
   ...     DummyEvent(6, 7, cave, 6),
   ...     DummyEvent(6, 7, home, 5),
   ...     ]

Helper function to shorten event selection::

   >>> def select(selector, now, events):
   ...     selector.now = now
   ...     return filter(selector, events)

   >>> import asmmobile.selector as selector

Select events have not yet ended::

   >>> select(selector.NotEndedEvents(), 3, events)
   [<4-5 @ cave>, <6-7 @ cave>, <6-7 @ home>]

Select events that are currently ongoing::

   >>> select(selector.CurrentEvents(), 1, events)
   [<1-2 @ cave>, <1-2 @ home>]

   >>> select(selector.CurrentEvents(), 2, events)
   []

Select events that have not yet started::

   >>> select(selector.FutureEvents(), 1, events)
   [<4-5 @ cave>, <6-7 @ cave>, <6-7 @ home>]

Select one event perlocation::

   >>> select(selector.LocationEvents(), 1, events)
   [<1-2 @ cave>, <1-2 @ home>]

Select events that start time in future is less that current time +
hiding time::

   >>> select(selector.NotHiddenEvents(), 1, events)
   [<1-2 @ cave>, <1-2 @ home>, <4-5 @ cave>]

   >>> select(selector.NotHiddenEvents(), 3, events)
   [<1-2 @ cave>, <1-2 @ home>, <4-5 @ cave>, <6-7 @ cave>, <6-7 @ home>]

Select events from future that are starting in certain time from now::

   >>> selectFuture = selector.FutureEvents()
   >>> selectFuture.now = 2
   >>> selectNotHidden = selector.NotHiddenEvents()
   >>> selectNotHidden.now = 2
   >>> select(selector.AndSelector([selectFuture, selectNotHidden]), 2, events)
   [<4-5 @ cave>]

Select maximum amount of events::

   >>> select(selector.MaximumEvents(3), 1, events)
   [<1-2 @ cave>, <1-2 @ home>, <4-5 @ cave>]

Make sure that events that start at certain time get all selected::

   >>> select(selector.MaximumEvents(1), 1, events)
   [<1-2 @ cave>, <1-2 @ home>]

Make sure that events that start at certain time get all selected::

   >>> select(selector.MaximumEvents(1), 1, events)
   [<1-2 @ cave>, <1-2 @ home>]

Check that events that have their start time changed will be returned correctly::

   >>> select(selector.StartTimeChangedEvents(), 1, events)
   [<4-5 @ cave>, <6-7 @ home>]

Check that original start time returns correct events even when
current start time is not selected::

   >>> select(selector.NotHiddenOriginalEvents(), 0, events)
   [<1-2 @ cave>, <1-2 @ home>, <4-5 @ cave>]
