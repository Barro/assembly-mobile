This needs original Python 2.4 or 2.5, easy install from setuptools
and and zc.buildout.

Note that by using your system's default Python this application will
not work as Zope needs Python not to be broken! And system's default
Python installations usually are.

To get stand-alone installation of this application that includes
Python interpreter, run following commands under this directory:

./setup.sh

This will install all dependencies under python/ directory.

Run this program by running:
bin/zeoserver start
bin/asmmobile-ctl fg

And by default this will listen to http://localhost:8080/ with admin
user/password being admin/admin.
